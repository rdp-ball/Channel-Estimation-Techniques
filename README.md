# Channel-Estimation-Techniques

This repository contains various channel estimation techniques used in wireless communication systems. The focus is on the implementation and analysis of these techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission by effectively estimating the channel .

## Overview

Channel estimation is a critical process in wireless communications, enabling the receiver to estimate the channel's state and mitigate its effects on the transmitted signal. This repository provides:

- Implementations of popular channel estimation techniques.
- Comparative analysis of the performance of these techniques under different conditions.
- Documentation and resources to understand the theory and application of channel estimation.

## Techniques Covered

1. **Least Squares (LS) Estimation**
2. **Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) Estimation**
3. **Bayesian Channel Estimation**
4. **Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation**
